# Checkout_Discrete_Event_Simulation
An implementation of a checkout system using discrete event simulation to show the series of arrivals and departures involved in the system. Simualtion consists of a single counter that services incoming customers and appropriately dismisses them once services are completed. Interarrival times of customers are generated in a pseudo random fashion using the box-mueller probability distribution. 

Simulation outputs all events in the output file along with various statistics of the simulation.
